                <p>Douglas County Amateur Radio Emergency Service (DC ARES) is the backbone of emergency communications for the Omaha metro area. Working closely with Douglas County Emergency Management Agency, the Omaha Metro Medical Response System (OMMRS), and the National Weather Service, DC ARES volunteers provide critical communications during disasters and severe weather.</p>
                <p>DC ARES members are trained SKYWARN spotters and regularly staff the National Weather Service office in Valley, Nebraska during severe weather events. They hold weekly training and information nets on Sunday nights at 9:00 PM on the K0USA 146.940 repeater. After the devastating 1975 tornado, the City of Omaha recognized the critical role amateur radio played by awarding a $10,000 grant to establish dedicated emergency communications facilities. Today, DC ARES continues this proud tradition of public service, and they welcome new volunteers interested in emergency communications and storm spotting.</p>
